#SMSGHJS
JavaScript library that interfaces that interfaces with the SMSGH api

Still in development. You can check out the code and give reviews. I would appreciate that a lot. If there is any particular functionality you would like me to add just open an issue and I would check it out.

This library is not yet complete. Check out the [smsgh developers portal](http://developers.smsgh.com) to see all the related api.

No test has been written yet.

I'm using the [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) way to code the javascript.
